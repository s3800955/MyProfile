## Welcome to Jason Boden's Personal Profile

On my profile, i will be explaining to you a little bit about myself, my interests in the Information Technology field, The ideal
job that i wish to strive for & why im attracted to said job, i will also explain the skills, experience and qualifications needed
for the job.


### About me

So lets start with the basics.
My name is Jason John Boden, My middle name comes from my father, who's middle name is also John... pretty unique right!
Alright jokes aside, I'm a 21 year old University student studying my Bachelor of Information Technology, As i have always shown an interest in the IT world, but we will get into that soon.
My birthday is on the 16th of march, funny enough, just a couple days after my fathers birthday, and on the same day as my
grandmothers birthday!
I have been playing Video games since a very young age, Both on a Console, and on the Computer, but i really took a strong
attachment to all things computer around the age of 11 to 13.

### My interest in IT

Now im going to get into my Interests in Information Technology.
Firstly, my interest in IT, I'll come out by saying straight away, i love my computer, my technology, the things im able to do
with it all, let me get into more detail on that.
But first lets go back and look at when i first started being interested in IT, As i said previously, I began playing Video 
games
at the age of around 7 to 9, Starting from console and moving along to Gaming on a computer, i didnt even know gaming on a
computer was possible until meeting my now to be brother-inlaw, who introduced me to video games on the computer, i took a very
strong interest and passion to gaming, but of course, with many computers came the issues, problems with my Game, or my Computer 
that i did not knowhow to solve, which got me interested.
I knew something was wrong when an issue came up, and it frustrated me not knowing how to fix said issue, so i began tyring to
fix the issue on my own, not knowing what i was doing, often times i would make the issue worse, but i kept trying, eventually
i started fixing the issues more and more, I realized how much i enjoyed not only playing with the computer, but fixing issues
that came up, before long my whole family was bringing me their technology with some type of issue asking me to help them fix
it, Which still is happening today!
From that time until now, I've worked for a small business named Computers & More, my experience has been a greate one working for this small business, i learned troubleshooting hardware issues & software/program issues, Completely building a computer, Symptoms that a computer may have if a piece of hardware is faulty, I learned taking apart a laptop and doing various things such as cleaning out the inside, and replacing the laptop screen, I also learned Sales of comptuers and the best ways
to drive a sale for a computer.
So after all of that, why did i decide to study a Bachelor of Information Technology through RMIT University, and what do i expect to learn during my studies?
Well, I think the main reason why i decided to study IT is of course, my love for the IT related fields, It is something that
i enjoy, and always have enjoyed doing, And i chose to do my studies through RMIT after completing research on Universities, i found RMIT looked the best in my eyes, And after reading reviews on the university, and see'ing how many people have attended the University and all of the good things they had to say about it, I decided it was the University i wanted to study with.
As for what i expect to learn during my studies, Of course, the fundamentals of IT, I am expecting to learn a mixture of things in the IT field, programming, Cyber Security, How to work well in a group of like minded individuals to get the task or project we are working on complete, Meeting Deadlines, and further increase my knowledge on the IT world.
